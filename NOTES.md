## Session notes (All My Checklists)

- Fixed: Finish button in `RunChecklistView` now saves completion and dismisses back.
- Built and launched on iPhone 16/16 Pro simulator; manual flow verified.
- Basic UI tests scaffolded; the Run button selector needs stabilizing later.

### Next session
- Manually re-verify Finish flow; then stabilize UI test selectors for Run.
- Add icons/branding in `Assets.xcassets`.
- Address SwiftData warning (ModelContext sendable) by limiting seeding to main actor context.
- Polish empty states and haptics, add more sample templates.
